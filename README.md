Hey everyone,

I've upgraded this plugin to support Paper and all its forks (including FOLIA). 
While I didn't originally create it, most of the code is mine. 
I've been tasked with adding Folia support and updating it to version 1.20.6, 
which essentially meant recoding the entire thing.

Cheers!

Usage:

/totemtest <player>
